# problem #1
# Some people have just a first name and a last name. Some people also have a middle name. Some people have five middle names.

# Write a program that asks the user how many names they have. (If they have a first name, two middle names, and a last name, for example, they would type 4.) Then, using a for loop, ask the user for each of their names. Finally, print their full name.






# problem #2
# Write a program that prints even numbers 2 through 20 using a while loop.





#####################################for loops###########################

# problem #3
# Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 10 using a for loop.



#problem #4
# Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 10 using a for loop. Use an if statement to print only the odd numbers.




#problem #5
# Write a program that prints the numbers 1 through 10 using a for loop. Use an if statement to print only the even numbers.




#problem #7
# Write a program that asks the user for three test scores. The program should then report the average of these three scores. You will need:

# A call to input. You should only have one line that has this!
# A for loop.
# Arithmetic operators.



#problem #8

# Write a program that asks the user for three test scores. The program should then report the average of these three scores. You will need:

# A call to input. You should only have one line that has this!
